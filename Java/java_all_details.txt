1) Memoization(store already evaluated values in an array to prevent recalculation) of fibonaaci function
-> Students would be given code template and would need to fill in functions

Concepts covered:
Function Overloading, arrays, recursion, conditional statments,strings, exception handling



2) File reading and finding frequency of words, with special count for pattern matching words.
-> Again very basic template will be given, but file reading using BuffereReader would be done
by students

Concepts covered:
Regex, File handling, hashmap, iterating hashmaps



3) Creating children classes for a given "interface" of java.
-> Given an interface students would need to override functions of parent class, overload operators, etc. 
to create new classes with specified functionalities.
Eg: Vector(parent interface), Color(child class), Coordinates(child class)

Concepts covered:
Polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces
