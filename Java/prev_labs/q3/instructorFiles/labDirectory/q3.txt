In Parse1.java, read each line of the log file.
You would have to use BufferedReader, String (from the java library) as part of this process.
Insert the entries which you have read into an appropriate data structure, from the existing collections framework. 
While inserting, ensure that duplicates are not stored and also each line of log file is sorted (according to String comparison).
(hint: use something which implements the Set interface or its extension).
print after following above steps on stdout in same format as given in log.txt
