With the aim to fetch student ids and names, a certain someone messed up and
got the data merged instead of separated by commas. So instead of having columns
Student ID, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name
the file just contains
Student ID
with all the entries of a single row merged.
Task : Recover the file back to the format:
Student ID, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name.
You can assume "Student id" can only be numeric and any name starts with 
a capital letter. Assume no other special characters. Separate the fields using commas in the ouput.

Output ->
