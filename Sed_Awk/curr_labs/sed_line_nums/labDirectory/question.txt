Ever felt the requirement of copying contents of a script or a ".csv" along with line numbers??
(even if not, you will need it here ;) ) 

Task : You are given a "employment.csv" file and you need to modify the file to have line numbers.
(You might need to pipe output of one sed command to another).
Well, this is somewhat boring..., let's REMOVE the header of the file and print only 
entries of "High_industry" and "Value", separated by ':' and double quotes
around entries of "High_industry" (see example for clarity)
You are allowed to use pipe('|') for this activity but brownie points for not using it.

Eg : 
Input -> 
Week_end,Indicator,High_industry,Value
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,Total,2090110
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,A Primary,95150
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,B Goods Producing,405050
....

Output -> 
1 "Total":2090110
2 "A Primary":95150
3 "B Goods Producing":405050
....

Usage : 
script.sh > output.txt
