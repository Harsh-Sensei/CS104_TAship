After using quickly finishing your python script you realize that instead of "print" you have
written "printf" to yield strings to the standard output(terminal). Seems like you were not using 
good IDE(seed for following labs). 

Task : Given the file test.py, you need to replace all instances of "printf" to "print".
You need to ensure that only those instances of "printf" are replaced where it is used a function.

Eg : 
Input -> 
printf("eren")
printf = 33
htgprintf("mikasa")

Output -> 
print("eren")
printf = 33
htgprintf("mikasa")

Note : You need to take filename as argument to bash script
Usage : 
script.sh <filename> > output.txt
