Data aggregation is an important task on databases in order to represent a data using 
few numbers(total, average, etc.).

Task : Given the data in "employment.csv" you have to find sum of all entries in "Values" 
and append it to the end of the file("Total : <sum>").Further append "Created by : <first_arg_to_bash_script>" the file.
Also REMOVE the header of the file in your output.
Eg : 
Input -> 
Week_end,Indicator,High_industry,Value

2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,B Goods Producing,405050

2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,A Primary,95150
2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 34 days,B Goods Producing,405050
