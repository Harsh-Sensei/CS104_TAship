Imagine a situation when you want to print all lines between "if" and "else" of some script
that you would like to debug. Quite certainly, you would rather open that file and debug instead but 
lets do it with sed instead!!

Task : Given the file (whose name is to be taken as command line argument to the bash script "script.sh")
you have to print all lines between the first occurence of "if" and "else" in the file. 
Consider the example below for clarity.

Eg : 
Input -> 
def main():
    x = [y for y in lst if y < 6] 
    if n == m:
        print("Like comics?")
    if a == b:
        print("Asterix and Obelix")
    else:
        pass
    if g == h:
        print("Are friends?")
    else:
        pass

Output -> 
    if n == m:
        print("Like comics?")
    if a == b:
        print("Asterix and Obelix")
    else:

Note : "else:" is required to be print. Also note that only "if"s starting with indentation 
are considered(if inside list[] is not considered). 

Usage : 
script.sh <filename> > output.txt
