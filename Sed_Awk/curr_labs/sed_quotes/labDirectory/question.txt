Often when reading data from a .csv file you need to ensure that particular column of the 
tabular data is read as string or change some character to avoid ambiguity later.
The file "employment.csv" has a column named "Indicator" which 
requires to read as string and needs some modification.

Task : Replace all entries <entry> of column "Indicator" to <"entry">, (that is, double quotes 
around the entry) and replace all '-' in the record by ':'. 
Yield the modified file to "output.txt".

Eg : 
Input -> 2019-05-05,Number of paid jobs - 20 days,Total,1828160 
Output -> 2019-05-05,"Number of paid jobs : 20 days",Total,1828160 

Usage : 
script.sh > output.txt
