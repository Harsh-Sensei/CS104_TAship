Study the format of the file "sample.txt" which stores information about various user 
accounts. It includes various dummy user accounts too: these have user ids, but they are 
not allowed to login. All other users having something other than “/bin/false” as login 
shell are valid users and are allowed to login. This is indicated by the setting 
"/bin/false" for the login shell.

Task : Write a bash script, "script.sh", using awk to print the user ids (the first field) of all dummy 
accounts whose shell is "/bin/false".
The Sample Input File is -
UserID;Name;Designation;loginShell
10001;ajay;manager;/bin/false
1001;sunil;clerk;/bin/false
101;varun;manager;Valid
60123;amit;manager;/bin/false
401;tarun;peon;Valid

And after running the script the output should be - 
10001
1001
60123

Note : The input field separator is ";". 
Usage : 
./script.sh > output.txt
